## Limitation

Currently, when you switch between the editor tabs, the Node-RED editor will be reloaded due to [#16307](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/16307). This issue would be resolved when the new VS Code [Webview API](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_21#_webview-api) is released.

## Change Log

See Change Log [here](CHANGELOG.md)

## Issues

Currently, the extension is in the very initial phase. If you find any bug or have any suggestion/feature request, please submit the [issues](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-node-red/issues) to the GitHub Repo.
